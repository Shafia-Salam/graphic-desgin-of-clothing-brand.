# Theme
I designed the graphics according to season.
In summer season, we use a variety of colors,from cool blues to sunny yellows,along with tropical prints,lush green and soft pink.The lawn headcarf is a popular choice for summer hijabs due to its lightweight and breathable nature.In lawn fabric we use colors like lemon yellow, aqua blue and coral pink.Chiffon headscarves are also favored for their lightweight and airy texture,with shades like mint green,lavender and baby blue.
In the winter season, premium jarse,ribbed jarsey and instant jarsey hijabs are very popular.Dark color such as red ,black and purple are commonly used.
for the spring season, the color palette is full of warm and bright shades like poppy red , daffodil yellow, tangerine orange, peach pink and shades of light brown.
In autumn season,the colors like dark brown, beige and grey are very popular.
